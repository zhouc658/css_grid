    <h1>People Behavior on the 7 Train</h1>
    <p>
        This project visualizes human behavior inside the 7 train’s first cart, from Flushing–Main St to 74th St–Broadway, between 10:00 and 10:30 AM. I observed and recorded how many passengers were using their phones, not using their phones, or interacting with others. The visualization uses the 7 train line to show how the data changes across stops. Users can drag the cart to their preferred destination—like an actual subway—and at each stop, a bubble appears displaying the data for that station. The size of each station circle grows larger when more people are using their phones and smaller when fewer people are. Users can also press <strong>Enter</strong> to view inside the cart and see a heat map based on the data, offering a clearer visual comparison of different behaviors. A legend on the side helps identify which colors represent each activity.

        I chose to represent each behavior as a single person rather than a cluster of color to highlight individual presence within a shared space. Every person contributes to the atmosphere of the train cart—the dots collectively form a picture of how people occupy the same environment while performing different actions. The visualization evolved from a simple heat map idea into something more personal, where color represents not just data, but human individuality. It reflects how, even in a public setting, people remain isolated or disconnected, turning the train cart into a microcosm of social behavior within the city.
